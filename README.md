# ECE-445---DIY-Plantify
DIY Plantify is a self-sufficient, moving robot that detects and tests the ultimate location in a room for a plant to be located, in order to have an optimal amount of sunlight. As well, it can detect moisture levels in a plant, which will then alert the user when moisture levels are, and needs to be watered.
